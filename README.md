# Digital Twin of Aquaculture Greenhouse @ Cornell University

This repository contains the digital twin model of a research-oriented aquaculture greenhouse located at Cornell University. The project aims to simulate, monitor, and manage aquaculture systems in a controlled greenhouse environment using real-time data, visual interfaces, and predictive modeling. It also serves as a training platform for students, lab assistants, and researchers learning about aquaculture operations.
